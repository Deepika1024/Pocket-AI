Treat it like an important appointment. Even 30-60 minutes consistently is better than sporadic marathon sessions.\n3.  **Find a Learning Buddy or Community:** Join online forums (like Reddit's r/MachineLearning or r/learnmachinelearning), Discord servers, or local meetups. Having others to discuss concepts with, ask questions, and share progress can be incredibly motivating.\n4.  **Build Projects, Projects, Projects!** This is arguably the most important tip. Applying what you learn makes it stick. Start small:\n    *   Analyze a dataset you find interesting.\n    *   Replicate a simple model from a tutorial.\n    *   Participate in a beginner Kaggle competition.\n    *   Document your projects on GitHub.\n5.  **Embrace the \"Struggle\":** It's okay to get stuck. It's part of the learning process. When you hit a roadblock:\n    *   Take a short break.\n    *   Re-read the documentation or a different explanation.\n    *   Search online for solutions (Stack Overflow is your friend!).\n    *   Ask for help from your learning community.\n6.  **Track Your Progress:** Keep a journal or use a task management app to log what you've learned and accomplished. Seeing how far you've come is a powerful motivator.\n7.  **Mix Up Your Learning Methods:** If you're tired of reading, watch a video. If videos are getting repetitive, try a coding challenge. Variety keeps things fresh.\n8.  **Focus on Understanding, Not Just Memorization:** Try to explain concepts in your own words. If you can teach it, you understand it.\n9.  **Celebrate Milestones:** Finished a challenging course? Deployed your first model? Give yourself a pat on the back! Acknowledge your achievements to stay motivated.\n10. **Remember Your \"Why\":** Revisit your initial reasons for wanting to become an ML Engineer. This passion will reignite your drive when it starts to fade.\n\n---\n\nYou've got a clear path ahead now. Take it one step at a time, be patient with yourself, and most importantly, enjoy the process of learning and building! I'm here to support you as you progress.
